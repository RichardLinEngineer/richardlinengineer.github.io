            <p>
                I'm Richard Lin from Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, an undergraduate at Temple University. 
                I'm passionate about software-hardware integration and enjoy developing programs that interact directly with circuits, sensors, and devices. 
                I'm eager to pursue internships and opportunities that allow me to apply these skills to innovative projects.

                In my free time, I enjoy running, playing badminton, coding, and exploring new technologies. 
                Running and playing badminton helps me stay fit, clear my mind, and socialize with friends. 
                Coding allows me to create and innovate, and I love learning about the latest advancements in technology.
